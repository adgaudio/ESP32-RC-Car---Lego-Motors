Build a remote control car using an ESP32 and lego power functions DC motors.  Control it using the tilt sensor on a mobile device, with variable speed control and variable direction control.

The arduino code works - a phone moves the DC motors!  Schematic and hardware bill of materials coming soon.

This is a one-time project.  It will not be regularly maintained.
